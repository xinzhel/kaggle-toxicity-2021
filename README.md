validation_data(30k rows)  vs comments_to_score vs test data (LB)
pl is 10k


cannot beat my first baseline run's LB score
* more data
* targeted pretraining
8 folds and no leaks
Baseline run with roberta-large: CV: 0.74 | LB: 0.815
Pretrain with previous competition data: CV: 0.77 | LB: 0.7

* heavier regularization
* different loss functions
* different learning rate schedules.
